### Contribution of Geoscripting for Jan
Geoscripting is a must for me as MGI student. I would like to learn how to apply coding skills to geo problems. 
### Specific R and Python knowledge Jan
I have programming exerience in Java, but not much in Python and no in R. But this shouldn't be a problem. To finish our project we would need knowledge to handle big raster datasets. Also, the processing should not take much time
