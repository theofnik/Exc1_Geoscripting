## Made by Jan van den Berg and Nikolas Theofanous

### Potential contribution of Geoscripting 
#### Nikolas
1. Improvement of my scripting background
1. Integration of programming with the knowledge gained by previous courses
#### Jan
Geoscripting is a must for me as MGI student. I would like to learn how to apply coding skills to geo problems. 

### Specific R and Rython Knowledge 
#### Jan
I have programming exerience in Java, but not much in Python and no in R. But this shouldn't be a problem. To finish our project we would need knowledge to handle big raster datasets. Also, the processing should not take much time
#### Nikolas
**R language**
1. Basic principles of the language 
1. Improvement of my scripting skills

**Python language**
1. We're not sure yet
